### Frog jump probability puzzle
## Oliver Snellman

# Frog crosses a river by jumping from a stone to another.
# The frog chooses randomly, to which of the remaining stones
# it jumps to. At minimum, the crossing can happen in one hop.
# At maximum, the frog visits each stone in order.
# What is the average number of jumps to cross a river?

frog_jump <- function(stones, n){
    
    counter <- c(NA)
    
    for(i in 1:n){
        current <- 1
        counter[[i]] <- 1
        not_finished <- T
        
        while(not_finished){
            stones_left <- length(c(current:stones))
            jump <- sample(stones_left,1)
            current <- current + jump
            
            if(current >= stones) not_finished <- F
            
            counter[[i]] <- counter[[i]] + 1
        }
