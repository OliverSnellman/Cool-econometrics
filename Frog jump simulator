### Frog jump probability puzzle
## Oliver Snellman 2019

# Frog crosses a river by jumping from a stone to another.
# The frog chooses randomly, to which of the remaining stones
# it jumps to. At minimum, the crossing can happen in one hop.
# At maximum, the frog visits each stone in order.
# What is the average number of jumps to cross a river?
# Reaching the last stone means crossing the river.
